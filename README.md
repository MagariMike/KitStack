# KitStack âš½

### _The one-stop football shirt collector's app that's easy to use and helps you keep track of your jerseys. "If Pinterest and eBay had a baby that collected football shirts, it would be called KitStack."_

KitStack started out as a final projoct idea for the Command Shift coding bootcamp that i recently graduted from and the initial idea was worked on my myself (Mike Brewer), Joeseph Redmond (https://github.com/josephredmond5) and Rob Barber (https://github.com/rjrobbie/rjrobbie). Since graduating I am conitnueing to work on this application to add further functionality.
