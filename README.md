# KitStack âš½

### _The one-stop football shirt collector's app that's easy to use and helps you keep track of your jerseys. "If Pinterest and eBay had a baby that collected football shirts, it would be called KitStack."_

KitStack was a collaboration between myself (Mike Brewer), Joeseph Redmond (https://github.com/josephredmond5) and Rob Barber (https://github.com/rjrobbie/rjrobbie) over a 2 and a half week period. The aim of this project was to demonstrate working as part of a development team using GitHub best practices, Agile methodologies such as Kanban boards, Wireframing (Figma), Mob programming, Pair programming etc.
